# TrainingDiary

This mobile app is developed utilizing React Native technology. The app is designed to save information about workouts. All data is saved into phone's memory.

## Home screen

On the home screen, there is a calendar where the background of the dates is highlighted based on whether a strength training exercise, a cardio workout, or both were completed on that day. Below the calendar, the selected day and the exercises completed on that day are displayed.
